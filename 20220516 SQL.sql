/*
Notes:
According to the DATEDIFF function, there are 12 months from 2017-12-31 to 2018-12-31, but 11 months from 2018-1-1 to 2018-12-31. This is different from real life. 
In this question, I can use DATEDIFF(MONTH, [StartDate], [EndDate])+1 to solve this problem, but it will cause other problems in real projects.
So I set the month to 30 days. If the total number of days in the last month exceeds 15 days, count it as a whole month, otherwise ignore it.
I think it should be setup base on the company's rules.
